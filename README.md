## Using targeted sequence capture to genetically map the location of the sex-linked region in the willow species *Salix nigra*

This repository contains the scripts and analysis notebooks used for the
creation of a novel genotyping platform that I designed, and its
implementation reported in my paper
[Sex determination through X-Y heterogamety in *Salix nigra*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-020-00397-3), published in the journal *Heredity* in 2021.

### Contents

1. [README.md](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/salix-nigra-slr/blob/master/README.md): this file

2. [scripts/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/salix-nigra-slr/blob/master/scripts/): A Python script I wrote to screen SNP and indel polymorphism to design the targeted sequence capture array

3. [notebooks/](https://github.com/BrianSanderson/salix-nigra-slr/blob/master/notebooks/): Notebooks that detail the analyses reported in the manuscript in Jupyter Notebook format

The raw read data obtained through targeted sequence capture will be available at the [NCBI short read archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA614933) after the manuscript has been accepted for publication.
